## Introduction

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt identification and treatment. This project aims to develop a classification model capable of accurately predicting a patient's risk of developing sepsis based on various clinical indicators.

## Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can effectively classify patients into two categories:

- **High Risk**: Patients who are at a high risk of developing sepsis.
- **Low Risk**: Patients who are at a low risk of developing sepsis.

Accurate classification is crucial for early intervention and improving patient outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains anonymized patient data, including vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical notes. Key features include temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, white blood cell count, and respiratory rate, among others.

## Machine Learning Models

Various machine learning algorithms are explored to classify patients' sepsis risk, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

Each model is trained and evaluated using appropriate cross-validation techniques to ensure robust performance.

## Evaluation Metrics

The selection of the final model is based on several evaluation metrics, with a particular emphasis on **recall**. Given the critical nature of sepsis detection, maximizing recall helps minimize false negatives, ensuring that patients at risk are not overlooked.

Other metrics considered include precision, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive assessment of each model's performance.

## Conclusion

After evaluating multiple machine learning models, the chosen model demonstrates superior recall performance, effectively identifying patients at risk of sepsis while minimizing false negatives. The selected model is deemed suitable for deployment in clinical settings to aid healthcare professionals in sepsis risk assessment.

## Usage

To use the developed sepsis risk classification model:

1. Ensure that the necessary dataset is available and properly formatted.
2. Train the selected machine learning model using the provided dataset.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, with a focus on recall.
4. Deploy the trained model in clinical settings for sepsis risk assessment.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Ensure that these dependencies are installed to run the project successfully.
